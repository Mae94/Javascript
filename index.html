                   <h2>1.WEBSITE</h2>
                   <p>Okay, so you can file this one under ‘pretty obvious’. Adding 
                       interactivity and behavior to otherwise static sites was what 
                       JavaScript was invented to do by Brendan Eich way back in 1995. 
                       It’s still used for that. This one’s easy. Any remotely modern 
                       web site is running JavaScript on some level. This one’s a gimme.
                    </p>
                    <h2>2.WEB APPLICATIONS</h2>
                    <p>As browsers and personal computers have continued to improve, so,
                         too, has the abilities to create robust web applications. Just think 
                         of applications like Google Maps. If you want to explore a map in Google Maps, 
                         all you have to do is click and drag with the mouse. You may see a part of the map 
                         that is less detailed that then fills itself in. That’s JavaScript at work behind the 
                         scenes.</p>
                   <h2>3.PRESENTATIONS</h2>
                   <p>A very popular use for JavaScript is to create presentations as websites. Who needs Powerpoint 
                       or Keynote? Using the RevealJS library this becomes really easy if you’re already familiar with 
                       HTML and CSS. If you’re not familiar with these tools, you can still use slides.com, which uses RevealJS 
                       to build a web-based slide deck for you.</p>
                   <h2>4.SERVER APPLICATIONS</h2>  
                   <p>With the advent of NodeJS a few year ago, JavaScript made its way from the browser and into the server. 
                       Since then, Node has been adopted by many major companies, such as Wal-Mart, as a key part of their back-end 
                       infrastructure.</p>  
                   <h2>5.WEB SERVERS</h2>  
                   <p>While we’re on the topic of server applications. Have you seen Node’s Hello World application? It’s easy to build
                        a web server in about 10 lines of code. Of course, you can create much more robust servers using node or the standard 
                        server application framework expressJS. Many of the previously mentioned applications using Node are actually built using 
                        the MEAN stack (Mongo, Express, Angular, Node), of which Express is a key component.</p>  
                   <h2>6.GAMES</h2>    
                   <p>While the browser hasn’t been a traditional games platform in the past, recently it has become a robust venue for games. 
                       Additionally, with the addition of the HTML5 canvas (more on that in a second), the level of complexity that is possible 
                       in browser-based games has increased exponentially. There are even browser games to teach you programming!</p> 
                   <h2>7.ART</h2>
                   <p>One of the new features in the HTML5 specification is the canvas element,which allows the browser to render three-dimensional shapes. 
                       This opened the browser as a new medium for digital art projects.</p>
                   <h2>8.SMARTWATCH APPS</h2>   
                   <p>Popular smartwatch maker Pebble has created Pebble.js, a small javascript framework that allows a developer to create an application 
                       for the Pebble line of watches in JavaScript. But Pebble makes up a relatively small part of the market share. What if you want to develop 
                       for iOS or Android…</p> 
                   <h2>9.MOBILE APPS</h2>    
                   <p>One of the most powerful things you can do with JavaScript is build applications for non-web contexts. That’s a fancy way of saying you can 
                       make apps for things that aren’t the internet. For instance, mobile devices are now the most popular way to access the internet. What this 
                       means is that ALL of your websites should be responsive (but that could be another blog post). Additionally, it means that mobile applications 
                       are as important a product as a web property for digital goods. The catch is that mobile apps come in two major flavors, Apple and Android. 
                       And those apps are written in two completely different languages. So that means you need three times as many developers to build and support 
                       a product for mobile devices plus the web. Here’s the good news: It is possible to have a ‘write it once’ solution for all three platforms. 
                       Phonegap is one of the oldest and well-established frameworks in this space. More recently React Native has come on the scene and shows a lot 
                       of promise of becoming the major player in the cross-platform space. Long story short: You can make mobile apps with JavaScript you can deploy 
                       and download right to their respective app stores. Here’s a list of apps made with React Native.</p>
                  <h2>10.FLYING ROBOTS</h2>  
                  <P>Yes, you read that right. Several commercially available quadcopters come outfitted with a simple OS that makes it possible to install NodeJS.
                       This means that you can program a flying robot using JavaScript.
                        As it’s probably pretty clear, Atwood’s Law continues to ring true but not in a bad way. JavaScript remains the most accessible programming 
                        language on the planet. So it’s great to see that it’s possible to create such a wide variety of projects using it.
